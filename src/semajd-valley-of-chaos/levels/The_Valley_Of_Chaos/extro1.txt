  (text (_ "-The end of the castle

#As Tux reached the end of the castle,
#he realized that the yeti that all
#the minions had been guarding was not
#in the castle.

#But in the corner, hidden in a pile
#of dust, Tux noticed there was a map.
#the map showed Tux that there was a
#secret passageway leading out of the
#side of the castle out to the sea.

#Tux saw that to the north-east there
#was a small island that appeared to be
#the retreat of the yeti.

#Tux left the castle through the secret
#passageway and swam in the direction
#of the island determined to find the
#oppressor of The Valley Of Chaos..."))
